# Express JS - Backend Template

A base JS Backend project that can be used as a beginning template.
This repo will still be updated as I'm not done with many features that should be implemented.

## How to run this project

This project runs with ExpressJS for routing, Dotenv for env var management and prisma for DB handling.

Make sure to have Node.js installed with the latest version.

```bash
npm init -y

npm install express dotenv prisma
npx prisma init
npm install @prisma/client

# This should properly install all the dependencies and prepare your environnement for dev-env
```

You might not need to run these lines as the node_modules are already installed.

Just run :

```bash
git clone #URL
```

## To do

- Base Routes/CRUD/Models
- Roles
- Proper Backend Structure
- Auth System
